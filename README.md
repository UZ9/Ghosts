# Ghosts
Ghosts plugin for BanditMC

# Info
Ghosts is a plugin (intially private) designed for the OP Prison server BanditMC. Periodically (by default every hour) a 'ghost', which is in the form of a villager by default is spawned one of many predefined locations. Ghosts have health scaled to the average damage done on Bandit, and come in three different tiers. Players will have to kill the ghost in an amount of time in order to receive randomized awards from that ghost.
